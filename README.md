For our backend service we have chosen **Rust** 🦀 as Message provider with it’s memory safety and blazingly fast 🚀
computing.

In creating interface **TypeScript** and **Vue.js** helped us the most, with addition of TailwindCSS for styling and
Vite,
Docker for deployment our project is ready to launch at any time!

## Messages

This section provides features to search for users 👥, view currently online users, and browse through recent open
chats.🧑‍💻

preferences ⚙️ and needs.

## Storage

Because blockchain is immutable by default we need to ensure data integrity during contract upgrades by using stable
storage. This also allows to reliably save data on the blockchain. Ensures that the contract can always be brought back
to a known good state.
